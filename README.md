# Non-manual markers for wh-questions in Nicaraguan Sign Language

Created by Kat Marton based off of a project done in the Laboratory for Language and Cognitive Development (LLCD) at Wellesley with Professor Jennie Pyers. 

## Notes

This repository consists of R code files and csv data files. Note that for privacy purposes, the data have been deidentified and the IDs have been randomized. 
The demographics file, which is used in qc_cleaning.R, is intentionally not included in this repository for this reason. However, the analyses file will run
with only the final data files, which are WHQ_NM_ANON.csv and WHQ_QC_ANON.csv. I have included the data cleaning files simply because this is where I put in 
the bulk of my work on this project. 

# ELAN files

I have included the original ELAN files (without the corresponding videos). They can be opened in ELAN software, where the setup will be visible even though the 
participant's videos will not. They were coded using ELAN 6.2, which can be downloaded here: https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download

Please let me know if there is anything that is unclear at kmarton@wellesley.edu.
