# Non-manual markers for wh-questions in Nicaraguan Sign Language

Created by Kat Marton based off of a project done in the Laboratory for Language and Cognitive Development (LLCD) at Wellesley with Professor Jennie Pyers. 

## Usage

This repository consists of R code files and csv data files. Note that for privacy purposes, the data have been deidentified and the IDs have been randomized. 
The demographics file, which is used in qc_cleaning.R, is intentionally not included in this repository for this reason. However, the analyses file will run
with only the final data files, which are WHQ_NM_ANON.csv and WHQ_QC_ANON.csv. I have included the data cleaning files simply because this is where I put in 
the bulk of my work on this project. 

Please let me know if there is anything that is unclear at kmarton@wellesley.edu.
